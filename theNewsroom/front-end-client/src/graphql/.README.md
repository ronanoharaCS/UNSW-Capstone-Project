# GraphQL Queries

Here, we're going to define some GraphQL queries and VueJS will be using these.

The syntax it generally follows is described here: https://graphql.org/learn/queries/

Though remember, the postgraphile is our act GraphQL implementation. postgraphile follows
the philosophy of graphQL, but introduces elements, so that's why you want see the same 
variable names in the .gql queries here as you will in the official GraphQL docs.

To learn how to use graphQL and query the engine, I would look to our API's 
http://localhost:5000/graphiql page that it sets up when it is running.


# Help -> Example page

This page provides examples to querying GraphQL APIs

https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/examples/#Custom_queries__Rows_connection


# Filter in GraphQLs

The syntax and usage can be found here:

https://github.com/graphile-contrib/postgraphile-plugin-connection-filter

But you can also infer it from the graphiql docs.


# Future works

Consider adding: 
    - https://github.com/graphile-contrib/pg-many-to-many

Add indexing to foreign keys in the postgres schema as that will improve performance
    - not crucial
